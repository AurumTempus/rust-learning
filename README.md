## About Me
I'm Nikita, a aspiring developer focusing on backend, blockchain, VPN. This repository tracks my learning path, from basic lessons to more complex projects like a guessing game.

## Repository Structure
Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

- **lesson1/**: Basic syntax and variables in Rust. (What I learned: Fundamentals of ownership and borrowing.)
- **lesson2/**: Functions and control flow. Includes exercises on loops and conditionals.
- **guessing_game/**: A simple number guessing game in Rust. 
  - Technologies: Rand crate, std::io.
  - [README.md](guessing_game/README.md) for details on how to run.
- Other files: Main scripts for quick tests.

For full list, check the file tree.

## Key Projects
### Guessing Game
- Description: Interactive console game where user guesses a random number with limited attempts.
- Skills Demonstrated: Random number generation, input handling, error management.
- How to Run: `cd guessing_game && cargo run`
- What I Learned: Crate management, user interaction in CLI apps.


## Getting Started
To explore or run the projects:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`
2. Install dependencies: For Rust projects, ensure Cargo is installed (`rustup install stable`).
3. Navigate to a directory and run: e.g., `cargo run` in lesson folders.
4. Requirements: Rust 1.58.

If you encounter issues, check individual READMEs or open an issue.

## What I've Learned Overall
Through these projects, I've gained experience in:
- Rust fundamentals and best practices.
- Git version control.
- Documentation and clean code.

This repo is a work in progress — more lessons coming!
